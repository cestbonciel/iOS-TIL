To use RealityKit by importing in iOS. it is related to KODECO tutorial.

> Solved Problem
 
It couldn't be applied `turret?`, I searched the problem on KODECO site.
it might be the name of object. so I edited the name from 'Cannon' to 'Turret'.
and I also chose iOS version. Finally the error was disappeared.
